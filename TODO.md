# TODO: Remove Errors and Add Better Animations to JobsSection.tsx

- [x] Fix invalid Tailwind classes for "Expired" button positioning (change "top-15 left-30" to proper arbitrary values like top-[15px] left-[30px])
- [x] Import AnimatePresence from framer-motion
- [x] Wrap company groups with AnimatePresence for smooth enter/exit animations
- [x] Add layout prop to the company group motion.div for smoother transitions
- [x] Enhance company button animations with scale and color transitions on hover
- [x] Adjust stagger timing (increase staggerChildren to 0.5) and add slight delay for more dynamic effect
